				<p>
                    My name is Matt Ames.  I have been a programmer for about 17 years.
                    I was in the Marine Corps from 1988-1992.
                    I have a degree in Biology from UNC that I recieved in 1995.  FYI - The Biology degree that I received was broken.  It never earned me a single dime.
